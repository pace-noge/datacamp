Which models of the data include interaction terms?
Recall from the video that interaction terms involve products of features.

Suppose we have two features x and y, and we use models that process the features as follows:

βx + βy + ββ
βxy + βx + βy
βx + βy + βx^2 + βy^2
where β is a coefficient in your model (not a feature).

Which expression(s) include interaction terms?
