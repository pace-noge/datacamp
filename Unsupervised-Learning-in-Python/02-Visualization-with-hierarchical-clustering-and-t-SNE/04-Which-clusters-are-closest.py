Which clusters are closest?
In the video, you learned that the linkage method defines how the distance between clusters is measured. In complete linkage, the distance between clusters is the distance between the furthest points of the clusters. In single linkage, the distance between clusters is the distance between the closest points of the clusters.

Consider the three clusters in the diagram. Which of the following statements are true?

A. In single linkage, cluster 3 is the closest to cluster 2.

B. In complete linkage, cluster 1 is the closest to cluster 2.
