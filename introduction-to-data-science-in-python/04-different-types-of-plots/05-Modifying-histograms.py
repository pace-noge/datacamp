Modifying histograms
Let's explore how changes to keyword parameters in a histogram can change the output. Recall that:

range sets the minimum and maximum datapoints that we will include in our histogram.
bins sets the number of points in our histogram.
We'll be exploring the weights of various puppies from the DataFrame puppy_weight. matplotlib has been loaded under the alias plt.

INSTRUCTION
-----------

1/3
Create a histogram of the column weight from the DataFrame puppy_weight.

2/3
Change the number of bins to 50.

3/3
Change the range to start at 5 and end at 35.
