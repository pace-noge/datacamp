Importing Python modules
Modules (sometimes called packages or libraries) help group together related sets of tools in Python. In this exercise, we'll examine two modules that are frequently used by Data Scientists:

statsmodels: used in machine learning; usually aliased as sm
seaborn: a visualization library; usually aliased as sns
Note that each module has a standard alias, which allows you to access the tools inside of the module without typing as many characters. For example, aliasing lets us shorten seaborn.scatterplot() to sns.scatterplot().

INSTRUCTION
-----------

3/3
Add an as statement to alias seaborn to sns
